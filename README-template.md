## Overview

This was a Frontend Mentor Challenge which allowed me to practice designing different layouts for the different screen sizes. This challenge helped me figure out how to use the @media and I was able to use what I learned for a different project. I had a lot of fun in the process, and I hope the code helps the next person. Happy coding!!!


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
  My process began with me first trying to recreate the image in Figma. After that was completed I used some of the suggested CSS to assist in building the project. I first made an attempt to build the layout, and afterwards I inserted the text and photos. Once that was completed, I continued adding more CSS to get it as close as possible to the image.

### Built with

- HTML
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

During the process of building this project, I learned more about how to work with @media.


### Continued development

I really enjoyed working on this project. It helped me with learning more about "@media", and I was able to use what I learned from building this page. I look forward to continue learning more about JavaScript and other tools that help with building websites.
